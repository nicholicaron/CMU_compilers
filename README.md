# CMU_compilers
### Auditing Carnegie Mellon's [CS-15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~411/) course on Compilers

- The goal here is to learn by doing, completing a working compiler for the C0 subset of the C-language using Rust, and writing a blog post about what I learned along the way @ https://www.nicholi.me/compilers/

> "If you don't know how compilers work, then you don't know how computers work. If you're not 100% sure whether you know how compilers work, then you don't know how they work."
